	I am currently a Ph.D. candidate supervised by professor Shing-Chi Cheung at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) with a research focus: software engineering, especially in software testing and analysis.
	As a member of the CASTLE Research Group at HKUST, it is very nice to work with a professional and very kind professor, as well as a group of innovative researchers.
