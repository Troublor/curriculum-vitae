	I am currently a research scientist at MegaETH (MegaRollup Inc.), a leading blockchain company focused on enhancing the performance of next-generation blockchain technologies. Prior to this, I was a research scholar at Purdue University. I obtained my Ph.D. in 2024 from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I was supervised by Professor Shing-Chi Cheung. My research interests include programming, software architecture design, program analysis, and bug detection. As both a software engineering researcher and a full-stack engineer, I am passionate about developing innovative solutions to improve software systems and tackle challenges in blockchain technology.
